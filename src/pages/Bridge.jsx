                So last week we tasted Turkey, it was a success it tasted good.
                This weekend I stayed a little closer to home and tasted
                Stalybridge and Ashton.

                As it was the 2nd Friday of the month I headed to Streetfest in
                Stalybridge centre (near big Tesco). A couple of ciders in I
                sampled the beef burrito from the Wrap Scallions truck...turns
                out eating a substantial burrito while trying holding a phone is
                impossible therefore no photos of said burrito however here is
                me approaching the queue looking chuft.

                  We didn't sample anything else, the burrito was quite
                  satisfying and as it was a lovely sunny evening it a was a
                  little crowded, so we headed home for a much needed chill
                  after we'd been working all week. Rootbeer and crisps made an
                  appearance as we watched multiple episodes of Narrow Escapes
                  (middle age looms guys).

                  Saturday was another chilled affair, plant based sausage
                  butties and brews and then a saunter into Ashton to check out
                  a used game shop I'd googled. Nipped into the market en route
                  and picked myself up a natty chapeau to keep the head cool in
                  the sunny weeks to come...what do you think guys?

                  My companion gave me a tour and showed me the chippy they
                  frequented as a child. A bit of a mid 80s time capsule, Gold
                  Medal has its charm in the pine wood paneling and murals of
                  the Swiss alps, the decor I am told hasn't changed since Bros
                  were riding high in the pop charts but who cares when the
                  chips are this good and plentiful!

                One could be forgiven I'm carb loading for a decathlon but for
                tea, aforementioned companion knocked up a mac n cheese and we
                settled in for my first ever Eurovision...interesting....
